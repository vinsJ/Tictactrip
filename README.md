# Tictactrip - By Vincent DEBANDE
 
 Hey, this is my technical test for the internship aplication at Tictactrip ! :bullettrain_side: :car: :bus:

 ## Some things about me 

 Well, first of all you might want to know who I am right ? (Even if you don't, here are some lines about myself, so... Sit back and relax :popcorn:)

 My name is Vincent, I'm 22 years old and I'm studying Engineering at ESILV (located in La Défense). Currently in M1, I'm specialised in **Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** !

 ### Why Data Science ? :bar_chart:

 Great question ! Imagine that you can apply your skills in ***ANY*** field, moreover, you like solving problems. Looking into data, trying to make it alive, make it speak. From that, you can demonstrate things, prove facts, predict stuff... 

 With the right amount of passion and curiosity, you can apply Data Science to every problem, in every company. 

 That's why I specialised into **Data Science and AI**!

 ### I'm realy proud of this :arrow_heading_down:

 **LéoLearning**: that's the name of the Association I created with 2 of my friends. 
 It's a mentoring association (60 members), older student help yougner ones through free courses all year long ! 

 I loved creating the processes, adapting them based on feedback from the student and our members and I also discovered how to work with a team and how much social skills are important to manage a team ! 

 Enough about me, let's dive into the test ! :tada:
